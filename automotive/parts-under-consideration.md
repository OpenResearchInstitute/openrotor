# Parts Under Consideration

## Automotive parts are widely available, relatively inexpensive, durable, and their manufacturing lifespace can be decades long. For production, we expect to use something like Toyota Camry wheel bearings, hubs, and possibly rotors (with brake). 

### This is a list of potential automotive and off the shelf industry parts that can be combined to make an operotor mechanical assembly.

For initial prototype, four flange bearings were purchased from Zoro. These are functionally equivalent to wheel bearings and hubs.
