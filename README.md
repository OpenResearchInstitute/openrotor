What do we need to do to get to the prototype for demonstration?

The sequence proposed moving forward:
- Collect as many as possible dish data sheets with weight and mounting pattern to try to find commonalities.
- Purchase / "procure" a "2 meter" (6 foot) diameter dish for local development. If Doug Phelps can send me all the remaining 2m dishes, then I will take them for prototype stations. 
- Pay for mechanical design of mount for common dish support maximum scope of commonly available dishes
- Fabrication / adjustment of mount locally. Hopefully it can be welded using alignment "tricks" to keep the bearings right.
- Attachment of actuators to axis (steppers / DC motors). Possible further mechanical design.
- Attachment of encoder system  (James to lead)
- Drive / servo controller / motion control electronics (James to lead)
- Interfacing with existing control system (This is us)
