#An open hardware and software rotator

This project is to design a rotator which can be constructed by people with modest fabrication abilities, and which can serve the needs of amateur satellite ground stations for missions to HEO, GEO, and Lunar orbits.

## Goals

* Serve the neds of the amateur radio satellite community
* Be available to as many people as possible, by being within their budget and skills
* Serve as a solid reference design that may be copied and modified by anyone
* Support antenna systems up to and including typical "2 meter" prime focus dishes
* Include a robust control system which interfaces to existing radio systems using 'standard' protocols
* produce a prototype rapidly in order to collect feedback and iterate on design

Detailed requirements will be outlined in documents in the docs directory

## What do you mean by "Modest Fabrication Abilities" ?

Contruction should use commonly available parts where possible. Possble examples are:
 * the use of standard linear rail or unistrut instead of custom fabricated tubular steel parts
 * The use of commonly available automotive wheel berbearings and mounts (e.g. automotive wheel bearings) for Axis Bearings
 * Fasteners should be commonly available anywhere in the world. Metric fasteners are strongly preferred.

Also where possible, custom parts which are required should be able to be built by someone using common tools such as a hacksaw, hand drill or drill press, etc.
